  summary: 'A straightforward binding of libsass for Python. Compile Sass/SCSS in Python with no Ruby stack at all!'
  description: |
    This package provides a simple Python extension module sass which is binding 
    Libsass (written in C/C++ by Hampton Catlin and Aaron Leung). It's very 
    straightforward and there isn't any headache related Python distribution/deployment.
